Base64 Encoding and Decoding

Base64 encoding is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that is commonly used to encode binary data, such as images, audio files, or any other binary content, into a text-based format. This encoding is useful when you need to transmit binary data over text-based protocols, such as email or HTTP, which may not handle binary data well.

In Base64 encoding, each group of three binary bytes (24 bits) is represented as four characters from a set of 64 different characters. The resulting encoded text is typically ASCII characters, making it safe for text-based transmission.

Here's a basic overview of how Base64 encoding works:

Divide the binary data into 6-bit chunks: Break the binary data into chunks of 6 bits each.

Convert each 6-bit chunk to a decimal value: Convert each 6-bit chunk into a decimal value, which corresponds to an index in the Base64 character set.

Map the decimal value to a Base64 character: Use the decimal value to look up the corresponding Base64 character from the Base64 character set.

Repeat the process until all binary data is encoded: Repeat steps 1-3 until all binary data is encoded.

Base64 decoding is the reverse process, where the encoded Base64 text is converted back to its original binary form.
